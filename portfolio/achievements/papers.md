## Intelligent and Smart Cloud Based Autonomous Robotic Kitchen System

Published at : IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems

This article discusses about the implementation mechanisms of autonomous cooking device, that cooks the dishes according to the user taste. The cooking mechanism is customized for different users using Artificial Intelligence and conventional Neural Network training algorithms. The device is capable of frying, cooking, churning applications that is embedded into a single device unlike the separate devices used in present day cooking. The prototype of implementation supports nine different ingredients which includes vegetables and liquid ingredients. Also, the software helps user to predict and manage their monthly commodities according to the cooking style, taste, quantity of dishes cooked earlier and schedule the dishes to time

## Two Dimensional compact CNC machine for industrial and remote application using IoT

Published at: International Journal of Advancements in Science and Technology · May 18, 2017

Present day CNC machines are bulky, huge, and is manually operated. This project aims at the development of compact CNC machine which is tiny when compared to the regular CNC machines, remotely operated and the network of these devices can do the given job more effectively. With the help of the software designed for this project one can remotely upload the design using standard JPEG format, which should be a binary image of the design. When the image is uploaded using the edge detection algorithms, the software converts the given image into array of the marking points on the surface. Once the software completes the task, it then uploads the array to the cloud and notifies the CNC machine which is placed remotely to begin the job. CNC machine first initializes itself and checks for its perfect operation and then notifies the user that it is ready for the job. As soon as the CNC machine is ready it receives the data from the cloud and start its specified operation. The operation of the CNC machine can be remotely monitored from the user via Internet and can pause or terminate the job whenever he wishes to do.

## Automation of college environment with IoT as solution

Published at:IETE 48th Mid Term Symposium on "Internet of Everything " · Apr 8, 2017

This project aims at presenting the concept of automated smart college, which uses wireless automated bell system, Time table and database handling, Database accessing, Announcements, Notice and smart display using a Single board computer Raspberry Pi 3, ESP8266 micro-controller with Wi-Fi embedded on a single chip, Android Power Tablets as Smart display and Android smart phones for the operation. It also can control the electrical devices like fan, light, projector etc. when the class is in leisure. It uses the WLAN technology to interconnect the devices and all the features can be accessed using Internet
